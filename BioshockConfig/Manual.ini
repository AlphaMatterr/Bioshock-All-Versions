[SecurityOverview]
TopicType=Security System
FriendlyName=Security System Overview
bHidden=false
Entry=When a Security Camera emits a bright cone of white light, it has caught a glimpse of you and is trying to focus on you. If you stay in its field of view for a few seconds it will see you clearly and sound an alarm.  If you duck out of sight before the light turns red, the camera will soon return to its unalerted state.
Entry=\nWhile the alarm is on, Security Bots will seek you out and try to kill you.  Alarms typically last for a while, but can be manually turned off at a Security Shutdown Panel.  If you shut off the system at a Shutdown Panel the bots go dormant and can then be hacked.  When the alarm ends, any active Security Bots fly away.
Entry=\nCameras can be destroyed with your weapons. Armor-Piercing or Electrical attacks are most effective.  The Security Bullseye Plasmid can turn Security Cameras to your advantage, so you may want to think twice about destroying them!
Entry=\nSecurity systems are localized within relatively small regions.

[SecurityBot]
TopicType=Security System
FriendlyName=Security Bots
bHidden=false
Entry=Security Bots are the muscle of the security system.  When an alarm sounds they will go to the location where the camera last saw you.  You can hide from them, but cameras will tell them where you are if you are seen again during an active alarm.
Entry=\nIf you cancel an alarm early with a Security Shutdown Panel, the bot is instantly shut down and goes into a dormant state.
Entry=\nWhen dormant, bots can be hacked.  If you successfully hack a dormant Security Bot, it will reactivate and follow you around, helping fight your enemies.
Entry=\nHacked Security Bots will not attack your enemies unprovoked, but will join in attacking any target you yourself have attacked.

[Turret]
TopicType=Security System
FriendlyName=Turrets
bHidden=false
Entry=Security turrets are gun emplacements that protect areas of Rapture.  They will attack you on sight regardless of whether a security alarm is sounding.
